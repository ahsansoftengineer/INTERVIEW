### BUILDING BLOCKS OF NESTJS

NestJS is a powerful Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications. It is built on top of Express and provides a range of architectural patterns and building blocks for creating robust applications. Here are the key building blocks of NestJS:

1. **Modules**:
   - NestJS applications are modular. Modules are the core building blocks that encapsulate related components, services, controllers, and other application elements. Each application has at least one root module.

2. **Controllers**:
   - Controllers handle incoming requests, process them, and return responses. They define routes and are responsible for request handling and response formatting.

3. **Services**:
   - Services are used for separating business logic from controllers. They contain methods and functions that perform specific tasks, such as database access, data processing, and more. Services are injectable and can be used across different parts of the application.

4. **Providers**:
   - Providers are a broad category that includes services, controllers, and other elements that can be injected. They are the main components that NestJS uses for dependency injection.

5. **Middleware**:
   - Middleware functions can be used to intercept requests and responses. NestJS supports custom middleware for global and route-specific use, allowing you to perform tasks like authentication, logging, and data transformation.

6. **Guards**:
   - Guards are used to protect routes or endpoints from unauthorized access. They can perform authentication, authorization, and other checks before a request is handled by a controller.

7. **Interceptors**:
   - Interceptors allow you to modify the request and response objects globally or for specific routes. They are useful for logging, data transformation, and other cross-cutting concerns.

8. **Filters**:
   - Filters are used to handle exceptions and errors at the application level. They can catch exceptions thrown during request processing and perform custom error handling.

9. **Pipes**:
   - Pipes are used for data transformation and validation. They can modify incoming data, sanitize it, and perform validation before it reaches the controller. Pipes help ensure that data is in the correct format.

10. **Exception Filters**:
    - Exception filters catch exceptions thrown during request processing and can handle them in a custom way. They are useful for translating exceptions into user-friendly error responses.

11. **Database Integration**:
    - NestJS can be integrated with various databases and ORMs, such as TypeORM, Sequelize, and Mongoose, to handle data storage and retrieval.

12. **WebSockets**:
    - NestJS provides built-in support for WebSockets using libraries like WebSockets and Socket.io. Real-time communication and event-driven applications can be built using WebSockets.

13. **GraphQL Integration**:
    - NestJS integrates seamlessly with GraphQL, allowing you to build GraphQL-based APIs and schemas.

14. **Microservices**:
    - NestJS supports microservices architecture through libraries like RabbitMQ and NATS. It allows for communication between different parts of a distributed application.

15. **Testing**:
    - NestJS provides tools and utilities for writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for your application.

16. **Swagger and API Documentation**:
    - NestJS can generate API documentation using tools like Swagger, making it easy to document and test your APIs.

17. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - NestJS provides a flexible and extensible authentication and authorization system that can be integrated with various strategies, including JWT, OAuth, and more.

18. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
    - NestJS uses a powerful dependency injection system to manage dependencies and promote modularity. This makes it easy to test and maintain your application.

These building blocks and architectural patterns make NestJS a comprehensive and scalable framework for building server-side applications in Node.js. NestJS encourages best practices and modularity, making it a great choice for building both small and large applications.
