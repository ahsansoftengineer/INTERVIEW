- ACID Properties: Transactions adhere to the ACID properties, which stand for:
1. Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are treated as a single unit. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
Consistency: Ensures that the data remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.
2. Isolation: Ensures that transactions are executed independently and do not interfere with each other.
3. Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any system failures.
