### Docker-Compose Defination
- Docker Compose is a tool that simplifies the management of multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define and configure complex application stacks using a simple YAML file, making it easier to orchestrate the deployment and scaling of services, networks, and volumes for your applications. Docker Compose is particularly useful for local development and testing of multi-container setups.

### Common Commands

Certainly, here are the commonly used Docker Compose commands in a single list:

1. `docker-compose up`: Start your application, creating and starting containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. `docker-compose up -d`: Start your application in detached mode (in the background).
3. `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
4. `docker-compose build`: Build or rebuild services (images) defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
5. `docker-compose ps`: List containers started by `docker-compose`.
6. `docker-compose logs`: View the logs of services.
7. `docker-compose exec`: Run a command in a running service/container.
8. `docker-compose stop`: Stop running services without removing containers.
9. `docker-compose start`: Start previously stopped services.
10. `docker-compose restart`: Restart services.
11. `docker-compose pause`: Pause all processes in services.
12. `docker-compose unpause`: Unpause services.
13. `docker-compose top`: Display the running processes of a service.
14. `docker-compose scale`: Change the number of containers for a service.
15. `docker-compose pull`: Pull images from a registry for services.
16. `docker-compose down -v`: Stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including volumes.
17. `docker-compose logs -f`: Follow (tail) the logs in real-time.

These Docker Compose commands allow you to manage multi-container applications defined in your `docker-compose.yml` configuration.
