1. wwwroot : To store static files of the application like js/css/images.
2. PROGRAM.CS : Entry point of the application
3. STARTUP.CS Configure Services and Request Pipline Middlewares
4. AppSettings.json : Configuration Settings like database connection strings and other things are saved here.
5. launchSettings.json

`launchSettings.json` is a configuration file used in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects to define settings for launching and debugging your application. This file is found in the "Properties" folder of your project and is used primarily by development tools like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and the .NET CLI.

Here are some common settings you might find in a `launchSettings.json` file:

1. **profiles**: This section defines different profiles for launching and debugging your application. Each profile specifies settings like the application name, command-line arguments, environment variables, and more.

2. **iisSettings**: If you're running your application with IIS (Internet Information Services), this section contains settings specific to IIS, such as the application pool and the SSL certificate to use.

3. **applicationUrl**: This setting defines the URL or URLs where your application will be hosted. You can specify both the HTTP and HTTPS URLs.

4. **sslPort**: If your application uses HTTPS, this setting specifies the port for the SSL connection.

Here's an example of a `launchSettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "iisSettings": {
    "windowsAuthentication": false,
    "anonymousAuthentication": true,
    "iisExpress": {
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5050",
      "sslPort": 44301
    }
  },
  "profiles": {
    "MyApp": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example defines a single profile named "MyApp" that uses IIS Express for hosting the application. It specifies the URLs for both HTTP and HTTPS, sets the ASP.NET Core environment to "Development," and enables the launch browser option.

`launchSettings.json` is a handy tool for configuring how your application is launched, and it allows developers to have different settings for various scenarios (e.g., development, staging, production) to streamline the development and debugging process.

### SLN
A `.sln` file is a solution file used by Microsoft Visual Studio, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for building, debugging, and managing software projects. The `.sln` file is a part of the Visual Studio solution structure and is used to organize one or more related projects within a single solution. Here's a brief explanation of its purpose and components:

1. **Solution**:
   - A solution in Visual Studio is a top-level container that can include one or more projects.
   - It provides a way to group related projects together for easier management, build, and organization.
   - A solution may also contain solution-level items like shared configuration files, folders, and references that are common to all the projects within the solution.

2. **Projects**:
   - Each project within a solution represents a separate software component, such as a library, application, or unit test project.
   - Projects can be written in different programming languages and may have various project types (e.g., class library, console application, web application, etc.).
   - Projects contain source code files, resources, references, settings, and build configurations specific to that component.

3. **References**:
   - Projects within the same solution can reference and depend on one another. For example, a web application project may reference a class library project.
   - References are used to establish relationships and dependencies between projects, allowing for code reuse and modular development.

4. **Configuration Settings**:
   - Solution-level configuration settings, such as build configurations (e.g., Debug, Release), platform settings, and solution-specific properties, can be managed at the solution level and are applied to all projects within the solution.

5. **Startup Project**:
   - In a multi-project solution, you can specify a startup project, which is the project that Visual Studio will run when you start debugging or run the solution.
   - This is especially useful when you have multiple projects within the solution, and you want to specify the main entry point for execution.

6. **Solution Items**:
   - Solution items are files or folders that are not part of any project but are included at the solution level. These can be used for shared resources or configuration files that are relevant to the entire solution.

The `.sln` file is essentially a text-based file that defines the structure and metadata of the solution, including the list of projects, their dependencies, build configurations, and more. Visual Studio uses this file to open, build, and manage the projects within the solution.

### .CSPROJ
A `.csproj` file is a project file used in .NET development, specifically for projects created using C# (hence the "cs" in `.csproj`). It is a fundamental component of .NET projects and is used to define various aspects of the project, including its source code files, dependencies, build settings, and other project-specific configurations. Here's an overview of what you can find in a `.csproj` file:

1. **Project Information**:
   - The `.csproj` file contains metadata about the project, such as its unique identifier, project name, and a human-readable description.

2. **Target Framework**:
   - It specifies the target framework or platform for the project. This helps determine which versions of the .NET runtime the project is compatible with.

3. **References**:
   - The file lists references to other libraries or assemblies used by the project. These references can include references to other .NET assemblies, NuGet packages, or external DLLs.

4. **Source Files**:
   - The `.csproj` file contains a list of source code files that belong to the project. These files typically include C# source code files, but they can also include other types of files used in the project.

5. **Compile Settings**:
   - It defines how source files are compiled, which may include specific compiler options, build configurations (e.g., Debug, Release), and conditional compilation symbols.

6. **Dependencies and Frameworks**:
   - In ASP.NET Core or multi-project solutions, the `.csproj` file can also define dependencies on other projects or frameworks within the solution.

7. **Output Settings**:
   - This section specifies where the compiled output (e.g., assembly or executable) should be placed and how it should be named.

8. **Package References**:
   - For projects that use NuGet packages,
