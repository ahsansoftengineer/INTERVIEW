Referential integrity is a critical concept in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It ensures the accuracy and consistency of data within a database by enforcing relationships between tables. Referential integrity is typically maintained using primary and foreign keys. Here's an explanation of referential integrity and how it works:

1. **Primary Key**:
   - A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each record is distinct and can be used to uniquely identify and retrieve data. Typically, primary keys are composed of one or more columns in the table.

2. **Foreign Key**:
   - A foreign key is a field in one table that references the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables. The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table, indicating that the values in the foreign key must match the values in the primary key.

Referential integrity is maintained through the use of foreign keys, and it ensures the following:

- **CASCADE**: This means that when a referenced record is updated or deleted, the change is propagated to the related records in the child table.

- **SET NULL**: If a referenced record is deleted or updated, the foreign key in the child table is set to NULL.

- **SET DEFAULT**: Similar to SET NULL, but the foreign key is set to its default value.

- **RESTRICT**: Prevents the deletion or update of a referenced record if there are related records in the child table.

- **NO ACTION**: Similar to RESTRICT, it prevents the deletion or update of a referenced record if there are related records in the child table.
