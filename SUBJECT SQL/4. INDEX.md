### Indexes Types in SQL
In SQL, indexes are structures associated with a table or view that help speed up the retrieval of rows based on the values in one or more columns. There are several types of indexes in SQL, each serving a specific purpose. Here are some common types:

1. **Clustered Index:**
   - A clustered index determines the physical order of data rows in a table. There can be only one clustered index per table, and the order of the index is the order of the data rows in the table. When a table has a clustered index, it is referred to as a clustered table.

2. **Non-Clustered Index:**
   - A non-clustered index does not alter the physical order of data rows in a table. Instead, it creates a separate structure that includes a sorted list of references to the table rows. A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

3. **Unique Index:**
   - A unique index ensures that the indexed columns contain unique values, similar to a unique constraint. It can be applied to both clustered and non-clustered indexes.

4. **Composite Index:**
   - A composite index is an index on multiple columns. It is useful when queries involve conditions on multiple columns. The order of columns in a composite index is crucial, and it affects the efficiency of the index for different query conditions.

5. **Covering Index:**
   - A covering index includes all the columns required to satisfy a query, eliminating the need to access the actual data pages. This can significantly improve query performance, especially for queries that retrieve a small set of columns.

6. **Full-Text Index:**
   - A full-text index is used for searching and indexing the content of character-based columns, typically used in text-based searches. It enables efficient searching for words or phrases within large text data.

7. **Spatial Index:**
   - A spatial index is used for optimizing queries involving spatial data types, such as geometry or geography. It helps improve the performance of spatial queries, such as finding points within a certain distance or inside a specific region.

8. **Filtered Index:**
   - A filtered index is an index created on a subset of data rows that meet a specific condition. It is useful when queries consistently access a well-defined subset of data, allowing for a smaller and more efficient index.

9. **XML Index:**
   - An XML index is used to improve the performance of queries involving XML data. It can be created on columns storing XML data, providing a more efficient way to retrieve specific XML nodes or values.

10. **Columnstore Index:**
    - Columnstore indexes are designed for data warehousing scenarios. They store and manage data in columnar format, improving compression and enabling high-speed analytics queries on large datasets.
