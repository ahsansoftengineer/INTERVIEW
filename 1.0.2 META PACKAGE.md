A "meta package" in the context of .NET Core typically refers to a NuGet package that serves as a high-level or "meta" package to simplify the inclusion of multiple related packages or libraries in a .NET project. These packages are often used to provide a collection of related functionality or libraries under a single, convenient package name.

A meta package in .NET Core can help you manage dependencies more easily, especially when your application relies on several individual packages that are commonly used together. Instead of adding each individual package as a dependency in your project, you can include the meta package, which in turn references the required packages. This simplifies the process of managing and updating dependencies.

Here are some common examples of meta packages in .NET Core:

1. **Microsoft.AspNetCore.All**: This is a meta package provided by Microsoft that includes a comprehensive set of libraries and dependencies for building ASP.NET Core web applications. It simplifies the process of including all the necessary packages for web development.

2. **Microsoft.Extensions.All**: Similar to the above, this is a meta package that includes a collection of packages related to Microsoft's Extension Libraries, such as configuration, dependency injection, and logging.

3. **EntityFrameworkCore.All**: This meta package includes the Entity Framework Core and its various database providers, making it easier to set up and manage Entity Framework Core in your application.

4. **AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection**: A meta package that includes AutoMapper and its dependency for ASP.NET Core dependency injection integration.

To use a meta package, you simply add it as a dependency in your project's `.csproj` file or use the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or the .NET CLI. The meta package, in turn, will include references to all the required packages and versions.

For example, to add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` meta package to your ASP.NET Core project, you can modify your `.csproj` file like this:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.All" Version="2.2.8" />
</ItemGroup>
```

This simplifies the management of dependencies and ensures that your application has the necessary libraries to work with the associated framework or technology stack. However, it's important to note that meta packages may include more dependencies than your project needs, so consider the trade-offs and ensure compatibility with your specific requirements when using them.
