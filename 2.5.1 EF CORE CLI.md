Entity Framework Core (EF Core) provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for managing database-related tasks, including migrations, database updates, and more. Here are some common EF Core CLI commands:

1. `dotnet ef migrations add <name>`: Creates a new migration with the specified `<name>`. Migrations are used to represent changes to the database schema.

2. `dotnet ef database update`: Applies pending migrations to the database, updating its schema to match the latest migration.

3. `dotnet ef migrations remove`: Removes the last applied migration. Be cautious when using this command, as it affects the database schema.

4. `dotnet ef migrations list`: Lists all the migrations in the project and their status (applied or not).

5. `dotnet ef database drop`: Drops the database that the context is configured to use.

6. `dotnet ef dbcontext info`: Shows information about the DbContext, including the connection string.

7. `dotnet ef dbcontext list`: Lists all the DbContext types found in the project.

8. `dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold`: Generates code for a DbContext and entity classes from an existing database. This can be useful for reverse engineering an existing database.

9. `dotnet ef dbcontext script`: Generates a SQL script that represents the schema for the current DbContext. This can be useful for generating SQL scripts for database creation.

10. `dotnet ef dbcontext optout`: Configures the DbContext to be excluded from design-time DbContext discovery.

11. `dotnet ef database update <targetMigration>`: Updates the database schema to a specific migration.

12. `dotnet ef migrations script`: Generates a SQL script for applying migrations. This can be useful for database version control.

These are some of the most commonly used EF Core CLI commands. You can run `dotnet ef --help` or `dotnet ef <command> --help` to get more details on each command and their available options and parameters. Additionally, make sure that you have Entity Framework Core tools installed by including the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` package in your project.


### BUILDING BLOCKS OF EF CORE

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET, allowing developers to work with databases using object-oriented code. EF Core has several building blocks and concepts that make it powerful and flexible:

1. **DbContext**:
   - The `DbContext` is the main entry point to the Entity Framework. It represents the database session and is responsible for managing database connections, tracking changes, and saving data to the database.

2. **Entities**:
   - Entities are C# classes that represent database tables or views. They map to database objects, and each entity typically corresponds to a row in a table.

3. **DbSet**:
   - A `DbSet` is a property on the `DbContext` that represents a collection of entities from a specific table in the database. You can use it to query, insert, update, and delete records.

4. **Migrations**:
   - Migrations are used to manage the schema of your database. EF Core generates migration files based on changes in your data model, and you can apply these migrations to update the database schema.

5. **Configuration**:
   - You can configure how EF Core maps entities to database tables using attributes or fluent API configurations. This allows you to specify column names, data types, relationships, and more.

6. **LINQ Queries**:
   - EF Core allows you to write LINQ queries against your data model, making it easy to retrieve, filter, and transform data from the database.

7. **Change Tracking**:
   - EF Core tracks changes to entities, which means it knows which records need to be inserted, updated, or deleted when you save changes to the database.

8. **Transactions**:
   - EF Core supports transactions, which allow you to group multiple database operations into a single unit of work. Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity.

9. **Lazy Loading and Eager Loading**:
   - EF Core supports both lazy loading and eager loading of related entities. Lazy loading loads related data on demand, while eager loading retrieves related data in a single query.

10. **Database Providers**:
    - EF Core is extensible and supports various database providers, including SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more. You can choose the provider that best fits your application's needs.

11. **In-Memory Database**:
    - EF Core provides an in-memory database provider that allows you to write unit tests without interacting with a real database.

12. **Database First, Code First, and Model First Approaches**:
    - EF Core supports different approaches for working with databases, including database-first (designing the database first and generating the model), code-first (designing the model first and generating the database), and model-first (using a visual designer to create the model).

13. **Stored Procedures and Functions**:
    - EF Core can work with stored procedures and database functions for custom data access and operations.

14. **Concurrency Control**:
    - EF Core supports optimistic concurrency control by allowing you to use version columns or properties to track changes and detect conflicts when updating records.

15. **Global Query Filters**:
    - EF Core lets you define global query filters to restrict data retrieval based on certain conditions. This can be used for features like soft deletes.

16. **Seeding Data**:
    - You can use migrations to seed initial data into your database during the database initialization process.

17. **Logging and Error Handling**:
    - EF Core provides built-in logging and error handling to help you diagnose issues and monitor database interactions.

18. **Asynchronous Operations**:
    - EF Core supports asynchronous database operations to improve application responsiveness, especially in scenarios with high latency, such as network-bound operations.

These building blocks and concepts allow you to work with databases in a structured and efficient way using Entity Framework Core. Whether you're building a simple application or a complex enterprise-level system, EF Core simplifies data access and management in your .NET projects.
