### ANGULAR BUILDING BLOCKS

Angular is a comprehensive framework for building web applications. It provides a set of building blocks and concepts that help you create structured, maintainable, and robust applications. Here are the key building blocks in Angular:

1. **Modules**:
   - Angular applications are organized into modules. A module is a container for a group of related components, services, and other application code. The root module, often named `AppModule`, is the starting point of an Angular application.

2. **Components**:
   - Components are the basic building blocks of Angular applications. They represent specific parts of the user interface and encapsulate the HTML, CSS, and logic for that part. Components can be nested within each other to create complex user interfaces.

3. **Templates**:
   - Templates define the structure and layout of a component's view. They are written in HTML enhanced with Angular-specific syntax and bindings. Templates can display data and respond to user interactions.

4. **Directives**:
   - Directives are special instructions in the template that tell Angular how to modify or manipulate the DOM. Angular provides built-in directives like `ngIf`, `ngFor`, and custom directives can also be created.

5. **Services**:
   - Services are used to encapsulate application logic that isn't directly related to a specific view or component. They are often used to interact with external data sources, provide utility functions, and share data between components.

6. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
   - Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that allows you to inject services into components and other services. This makes it easy to manage the dependencies of your application and promote reusability.

7. **Modules and Providers**:
   - Angular modules declare the dependencies and components that should be available within a part of your application. Providers are used to register services and other injectable objects within modules.

8. **Routing and Navigation**:
   - Angular provides a powerful routing system for creating single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views. The `RouterModule` helps with defining routes, navigating between views, and passing data between components.

9. **Observables**:
   - Angular heavily relies on observables from the RxJS library for handling asynchronous operations, such as HTTP requests. Observables are used for managing and reacting to changes in data.

10. **Forms**:
    - Angular provides a sophisticated form-handling mechanism for both template-driven and reactive forms. These forms can be used for user input validation, submission, and interaction.

11. **Pipes**:
    - Pipes allow you to transform data in templates. They are used for formatting, filtering, and modifying the presentation of data before it's displayed to the user.

12. **Interceptors**:
    - HTTP interceptors are used to intercept and transform HTTP requests and responses globally, allowing for tasks like adding headers, authentication, or caching.

13. **Direct Access to the DOM**:
    - Angular provides a way to directly access and manipulate the DOM through the `Renderer2` API when necessary, although it's generally discouraged in favor of using Angular's declarative approach.

14. **Change Detection**:
    - Angular's change detection mechanism automatically updates the view when the application's state changes. It helps ensure that the UI remains in sync with the underlying data.

15. **Testing**:
    - Angular has a comprehensive testing framework that allows you to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for your application.

Certainly! Here are some high-level Angular interview questions that cover various aspects of the framework:

### Basics:

1. **What is Angular?**
   - Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It's designed to make both the development and testing of such applications easier.

2. **Explain the key features of Angular.**
   - Some key features include two-way data binding, dependency injection, modular development through components, services, and directives, and a powerful template system.

3. **What is two-way data binding in Angular?**
   - Two-way data binding in Angular allows automatic synchronization between the model and the view. Changes in the model automatically update the view, and vice versa.

### Components and Directives:

4. **What is an Angular component?**
   - An Angular component is a building block of an Angular application, representing a part of the user interface. It consists of a template, logic, and styles.

5. **What is the purpose of directives in Angular?**
   - Directives in Angular are markers on a DOM element that tell Angular to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or even transform the DOM element and its children.

### Modules and Dependency Injection:

6. **Explain the role of modules in Angular.**
   - Modules in Angular help organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. They encapsulate components, services, and other code, preventing naming conflicts and promoting code modularity.

7. **What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular, and why is it important?**
   - Dependency Injection is a design pattern where components are given their dependencies instead of creating them. It promotes loose coupling, code reusability, and easier unit testing.

### Services:

8. **What is an Angular service, and how do you create one?**
   - An Angular service is a singleton object created to encapsulate and share methods, data, or logic across components. You create a service by defining a class and registering it with Angular's dependency injection system.

9. **How do you make an HTTP request in Angular?**
   - Angular provides the `HttpClient` module to make HTTP requests. You can use methods like `get()`, `post()`, etc., to interact with a server and retrieve or send data.

### Routing:

10. **What is Angular Router, and how does it work?**
    - Angular Router is a powerful library for navigating between views in a web application. It allows you to define routes, associate them with components, and navigate between those components.

11. **Explain lazy loading in Angular.**
    - Lazy loading is a technique where you only load the modules and components that are needed, reducing the initial loading time of the application. In Angular, you can achieve lazy loading with the Angular Router.

### Forms:

12. **How do you handle forms in Angular?**
    - Angular provides two approaches for handling forms: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms. Template-driven forms rely on directives in the template, while Reactive forms are more programmatic and provide a reactive approach using form controls.

### Observables:

13. **What are Observables, and how are they used in Angular?**
    - Observables are a core part of Angular's reactive programming paradigm. They represent a sequence of values that may arrive asynchronously over time. Observables are used in various Angular features, such as handling asynchronous operations and event handling.

### Testing:

14. **How do you perform unit testing in Angular?**
    - Angular applications are often tested using tools like Jasmine and Karma. Unit testing involves testing individual components, services, and other units of code in isolation.

15. **Explain end-to-end testing in Angular.**
    - End-to-end testing involves testing the entire application as a whole, simulating real user scenarios. Angular applications are often tested using tools like Protractor.

### Advanced Concepts:

16. **What is Angular Universal?**
    - Angular Universal is a technology that allows server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications. It improves performance and search engine optimization by rendering pages on the server before delivering them to the client.

17. **How does Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation benefit Angular applications?**
    - AOT compilation is a process where Angular compiles the application at build time instead of runtime. It helps in reducing the application's size, improving performance, and catching template errors early.
