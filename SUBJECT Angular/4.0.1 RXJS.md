### RXJS

### SUBJECT VS REPLAY SUBJECT VS BEHAVIOUR SUBJECT
Certainly, let's discuss each of them without providing specific code examples:

1. **Subject:**
   - A `Subject` is a basic type of subject in RxJS.
   - It is both an observer and an observable.
   - It does not have a memory of previous values.
   - When an observer subscribes to a `Subject`, it will only receive values emitted after the subscription.
   - It is suitable for scenarios where you don't need to replay past values and just want to broadcast new values to current subscribers.

2. **ReplaySubject:**
   - A `ReplaySubject` is a type of subject that records multiple values from the observable execution.
   - It replays these recorded values to new subscribers.
   - You can specify a buffer size when creating a `ReplaySubject`, determining how many previous values should be stored and replayed.
   - Useful when new subscribers need access to a certain number of past values in addition to new ones.

3. **BehaviorSubject:**
   - A `BehaviorSubject` is another type of subject in RxJS.
   - It has a "current value" and stores the latest value emitted to its observers.
   - When a new observer subscribes to a `BehaviorSubject`, it immediately receives the last emitted value (or a default value if none has been emitted yet).
   - Useful when you want subscribers to always get the most recent value or need to provide an initial value to late subscribers.

   In RxJS, there are several types of Observables, each designed to serve specific use cases. Here are some common types of Observables:

1. **Cold Observable:**
   - A cold observable starts producing values when someone subscribes to it.
   - Each subscriber gets its own independent stream of values.

2. **Hot Observable:**
   - A hot observable, on the other hand, produces values regardless of whether there are subscribers or not.
   - Subscribers share the same stream of values. Hot observables are often used for things like events and mouse clicks.

3. **Unicast Observable:**
   - An unicast observable is synonymous with a cold observable.
   - Each subscription to the observable triggers a separate execution of the observable.

4. **Multicast Observable:**
   - A multicast observable, like a hot observable, shares a single execution of the observable among multiple subscribers.
   - It uses subjects or multicasting operators to broadcast values to all subscribers.

5. **Finite Observable:**
   - A finite observable emits a finite sequence of values and then completes.
   - It can emit a certain number of values and then automatically complete, signaling the end of the observable.

6. **Infinite Observable:**
   - An infinite observable continues to emit values indefinitely.
   - Examples include observables representing continuous streams of user inputs or real-time data.

7. **Synchronous Observable:**
   - A synchronous observable emits values synchronously and immediately when subscribed.
   - This means that the observer receives values as part of the call to `subscribe()`.

8. **Asynchronous Observable:**
   - An asynchronous observable emits values asynchronously over time.
   - Values are emitted at a later time, and subscribers receive them when they occur.

9. **Behavior Subject:**
   - A specialized type of observable that is also a subject.
   - It keeps the "current value" and emits it immediately to new subscribers.
   - Useful when you want subscribers to always get the most recent value.

10. **Replay Subject:**
    - Another specialized type of observable that is also a subject.
    - It records and replays a specified number of previous values to new subscribers.
    - Useful when new subscribers need access to past values.


### RXJS Operators

1. `map`: Transforms the values emitted by an observable using a provided function.

2. `filter`: Filters the values emitted by an observable based on a provided condition.

3. `mergeMap` (formerly known as `flatMap`): Flattens and merges the values emitted by one observable into another observable.

4. `switchMap`: Switches to a new observable every time a new value is emitted and discards the previous inner observable.

5. `concatMap`: Maps each value to an inner observable and concatenates the resulting observables, preserving the order of emission.

6. `debounceTime`: Delays the emission of values until a certain amount of time has passed without new values being emitted.

7. `throttleTime`: Emits the first value of an observable and then ignores subsequent values for a specified time interval.

8. `distinctUntilChanged`: Filters out consecutive duplicate values emitted by an observable.

9. `scan`: Accumulates values emitted by an observable over time, producing an accumulated result.

10. `combineLatest`: Combines the latest values emitted by multiple observables into an array or object whenever any of the source observables emit a new value.

11. `startWith`: Emits an initial value before the values emitted by the source observable.

12. `retry`: Re-subscribes to the source observable in case of an error, up to a specified number of times.

13. `catchError` (or `catch`): Handles errors emitted by an observable and allows you to recover from errors gracefully.

14. `take` and `takeWhile`: Limits the number of values emitted by an observable or continues to emit values until a condition is no longer met.

15. `pluck`: Extracts a specific property from objects emitted by an observable sequence.

16. `zip`: Combines values from multiple observables into pairs based on their order of emission.

17. `finalize`: Executes a function when an observable completes or errors, allowing for cleanup tasks.

18. `share` (and related operators like `publish` and `refCount`): Converts a cold observable into a hot observable, ensuring that multiple subscribers share the same source.
