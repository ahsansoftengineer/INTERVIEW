### SCHEDULAR
In .NET Core, you can implement scheduling and background tasks using various approaches and libraries. One common way is to use the `System.Threading.Tasks` namespace, which provides support for asynchronous tasks and parallel processing. Here's a basic example of how you can schedule tasks in .NET Core using `System.Threading.Tasks`.

1. Create a .NET Core Console Application:

Start by creating a new .NET Core Console Application using the .NET CLI or your preferred development environment.

```bash
dotnet new console -n MySchedulingApp
cd MySchedulingApp
```

2. Install Required Packages:

You can use the `System.Threading.Tasks` namespace without any additional packages. However, for more advanced scheduling and background task features, you might want to consider third-party libraries like Hangfire or Quartz.NET.

3. Implement Scheduling Logic:

In your `Program.cs` file, you can schedule tasks using the `System.Threading.Tasks` library. Here's an example of scheduling a task to run periodically:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Scheduling tasks...");
        
        // Schedule a task to run every 5 seconds
        while (true)
        {
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
            Console.WriteLine("Task executed at: " + DateTime.Now);
        }
    }
}
```

This code schedules a task to print the current date and time to the console every 5 seconds.

4. Run the Application:

You can run your scheduling application using the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The scheduled task will run in the background and print the current date and time every 5 seconds.

Please note that for more complex scheduling and background task requirements, you might want to explore dedicated libraries like Hangfire or Quartz.NET, which offer more advanced features and flexibility for managing scheduled tasks and background jobs in a .NET Core application.
