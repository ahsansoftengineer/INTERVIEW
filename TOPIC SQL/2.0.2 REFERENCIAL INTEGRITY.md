Referential integrity is a critical concept in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It ensures the accuracy and consistency of data within a database by enforcing relationships between tables. Referential integrity is typically maintained using primary and foreign keys. Here's an explanation of referential integrity and how it works:

1. **Primary Key**:
   - A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each record is distinct and can be used to uniquely identify and retrieve data. Typically, primary keys are composed of one or more columns in the table.

2. **Foreign Key**:
   - A foreign key is a field in one table that references the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables. The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table, indicating that the values in the foreign key must match the values in the primary key.

Referential integrity is maintained through the use of foreign keys, and it ensures the following:

1. **Child Table Records Exist**: When a foreign key relationship is established, it ensures that records in the child table (the table with the foreign key) can only reference records in the parent table (the table with the primary key) that actually exist. In other words, you cannot have orphaned records in the child table.

2. **Data Consistency**: It maintains data consistency by preventing operations that would leave the database in an inconsistent state. For example, you cannot delete a record in the parent table if there are related records in the child table, or you cannot insert a record into the child table that references a non-existent record in the parent table.

3. **Data Accuracy**: It ensures that the data in the database remains accurate and coherent. If a change is made to a record in the parent table, it cascades to the related records in the child table, preventing data anomalies.

4. **Query Operations**: Referential integrity also helps in query operations. You can use foreign keys to join tables and retrieve related data easily.

To enforce referential integrity, most RDBMSs provide mechanisms for defining foreign keys and specifying actions to take when a referenced record in the parent table is updated or deleted. Common actions include:

- **CASCADE**: This means that when a referenced record is updated or deleted, the change is propagated to the related records in the child table.

- **SET NULL**: If a referenced record is deleted or updated, the foreign key in the child table is set to NULL.

- **SET DEFAULT**: Similar to SET NULL, but the foreign key is set to its default value.

- **RESTRICT**: Prevents the deletion or update of a referenced record if there are related records in the child table.

- **NO ACTION**: Similar to RESTRICT, it prevents the deletion or update of a referenced record if there are related records in the child table.

Referential integrity is a fundamental aspect of maintaining data quality and consistency in relational databases and is a key part of relational database design and management.
