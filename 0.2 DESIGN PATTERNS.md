### REPOSITORY PATTERN
What is the use case of repository design pattern?
The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that provides an abstraction layer between the data access layer and the rest of the application. It separates the logic that retrieves data from the data storage layer, providing a more modular approach to software development.

The repository pattern is a design pattern commonly used in software development to abstract the data access layer.

Abstracting the data access layer means creating a separation or interface between your application's business logic and the specific mechanisms used to retrieve and manipulate data from a data source, such as a database. This separation provides several benefits, including:
1. Flexibility for Changing Database
2. Testability you can use Mocks
3. Maintainability when change of code occur doesn't need to updated whole application
4. Security can manage security at one place only
5. Reuse C

### Mediator
- In a .NET Core application, the Mediator pattern, often implemented using libraries like MediatR, provides a centralized way to handle requests and commands. It allows you to separate your application's components, such as controllers and application services, from the specific logic of those requests. Here's a concise explanation:

- .NET Core Mediator: It's a pattern and library that facilitates communication and request handling by decoupling components in your application. It involves defining requests, request handlers, and using a central mediator to manage request processing. This helps maintain clean and testable code, simplifying the organization of your application's logic.

### CQS / CQRS 
- CQS, or Command Query Separation, is a software design principle that suggests separating the actions that modify state (commands) from the actions that retrieve data (queries) in your application. It promotes clarity and maintainability by distinguishing between operations that change data and operations that retrieve data, leading to more predictable and testable code.
