Normalization Defination
Database Normalization is the Process of organizating Data to Minimize 
- Data Redundancy (DML QUERIES CAN BE SLOW)
- Data Duplication (DISK SPACE WASTAGE)
- Data Consistency (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)

Database Normalization is a step by step process.
Most Databases are in Third Normal Form (3NF) 
There are 6 Normal Forms, 1NF Thru 6NF

1NF
1. The Data in Each Column should be Atomic (Math, Physics, Chemistry) 
	(PROBLEM WITH PARTIALLY UPDATE)
2. Table Does not Contain NO REAPEATING COLUMN GROUP (EMP1, EMP2, EMP3)
3. Identity each Record UNIQUELY using PRIMARY KEY

2NF
1. The Table meets all the Conditions of 1NF
2. Move REDUNDANT DATA to a Seperate Table (EMPLOYEE AND DEPARTEMENT) IS STORED IN SAME TABLE
3. Create RELATIONSHIP between these tables using FOREIGN KEYS.

3NF
1. Meets all the conditions of 2NF
2. Does not contain columns (attributes) that are not fully dependent upon the PRIMARY KEY 

4NF
1. Meets all the Condition of 3NF
2. No Columns has Array, Sets in a Cell (PROBLEM WITH PARTIALLY UPDATE)
