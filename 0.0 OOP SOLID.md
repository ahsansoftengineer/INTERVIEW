## PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS

1. Procedural Prog, Object Oriented Prog, Functional Prog

### OOP (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. OOP is based on the following key concepts:

1. **Classes and Objects**: 
   - A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
   - An object is an instance of a class and contains both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data.

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (an object).
   - It helps protect the data by controlling access to it and ensures that data is only modified in a controlled manner through methods.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - Inheritance allows you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class inherits attributes and behaviors from the existing class.
   - It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy of classes.

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
   - It enables method calls to produce different results based on the actual object they are called on, which supports flexibility and extensibility.

5. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors.
   - It hides the unnecessary details while exposing only what is relevant, making the code more understandable and maintainable.

OOP promotes the organization of code into modular and reusable components, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend software systems. It's a widely used programming paradigm in languages like Java, C++, C#, and many others.

### SOLID (Single Responsi.. , Open Closed, Liskov Substitution, Dependency Inversion)
SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming, intended to help developers create more maintainable and flexible software. Here's a brief explanation of each SOLID principle:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.
   - Each class or module should focus on doing one thing well, making the code easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - You can add new functionality to existing code without changing its source code, promoting code reuse and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
   - It ensures that derived classes can be used interchangeably with their base classes, maintaining the expected behavior.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
   - Divide large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones to avoid forcing clients to implement methods they don't need.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) should be used to decouple high-level and low-level components, making the system more flexible and allowing easier substitution of components.

SOLID principles help create code that is more modular, easier to maintain, and less prone to bugs. Following these principles can lead to well-structured, flexible, and extensible software designs.
