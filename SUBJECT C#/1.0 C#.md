### Dynamic C# Example 
string jsonData = "{\"name\":\"John\", \"age\":30, \"isEmployed\":true}"; 
dynamic person = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonData);
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {person.name}");

As you can see, dynamic C# allows us to interact with dynamic data easily without creating a specific class to represent the JSON data. It also allows us to add new properties to the dynamic object at runtime, making it more flexible for working with data structures that may change or evolve during the application's execution.

### Structs & Classes & Record & Interface
- Structs: Structs are value types and are stored on the stack. When you create an instance of a struct, the entire struct's data is copied, and each instance is independent of others. Modifications to one instance do not affect other instances.
- Classes: Classes are reference types and are stored on the heap. When you create an instance of a class, only a reference (memory address) is stored on the stack, pointing to the actual object's location on the heap. Multiple references can point to the same object in memory, so modifying one object through one reference will affect all references pointing to that object.

#### Struct VS Class
Inheritance and Polymorphism
Default Constructor
Performance Considerations

#### Value Type vs. Reference Type
Syntax of Writing Struct and Class is Identical
- In C# 9, records were introduced as a new reference type designed primarily for immutable data structures. 
- When you define a record, it generates a set of methods automatically, such as Equals(), GetHashCode(), ToString(), and Deconstruct(), 

### Delegates
- In C#, a delegate is a type that represents a reference to a method with a specific signature. Here are some key points about delegates in C#:
1. Definition: A delegate is a type that defines a method signature, which includes the return type and the types of its parameters. You can create an instance of a delegate by assigning it a reference to a method that has the same signature.
2. Multicast delegates: A delegate can also reference multiple methods, which is known as a multicast delegate. When you invoke a multicast delegate, all the referenced methods are called in the order in which they were added.
3. Event handling: Delegates are commonly used in event handling, where they represent a callback method that's invoked when an event occurs. The event publisher defines a delegate type that corresponds to the signature of the event handler method, and the event subscriber assigns a reference to its event handler method to the delegate instance.
4. Anonymous methods and lambda expressions: C# provides syntax for creating anonymous methods and lambda expressions, which are essentially shorthand for creating delegate instances. These constructs make it easy to create delegate instances on the fly and pass them as arguments to methods or store them as variables.
5. Func and Action delegates: C# provides two predefined delegate types, Func and Action, that are commonly used in functional programming. Func represents a method that returns a value, and takes up to 16 input parameters, while Action represents a method that returns void and takes up to 16 input parameters.

### LINQ 
- LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) is a feature of .NET that allows developers to write queries in a programming language, such as C# or VB.NET, instead of using SQL statements. LINQ provides a unified syntax for querying data from various sources, including databases, XML documents, and collections.
1. LINQ to SQL: A LINQ provider that enables developers to query SQL Server databases using LINQ. It provides a mapping between database tables and C# classes, and allows developers to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the database.
2. Entity Framework: A LINQ provider that provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET. It supports querying databases using LINQ, and also provides features such as change tracking, lazy loading, and database migrations.
3. LINQ to XML: A LINQ provider that enables developers to query and manipulate XML documents using LINQ
4. LINQ to Objects: A LINQ provider that provides query operators for querying in-memory collections such as arrays, lists, and dictionaries. It supports a wide range of operations, including filtering, sorting, grouping, joining, and aggregation.
5. LINQ to SharePoint

### Generics
1. Generics is a feature in .NET that allows developers to write code that can work with a wide range of data types. Generics enable the creation of type-safe classes, methods, and structures that can be parameterized with one or more types. This allows code to be written once and reused with different data types, providing flexibility and reducing code duplication.
2. In .NET Core, generics are used extensively throughout the framework, particularly in collections such as List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, and HashSet<T>. Generics can also be used to create custom classes and methods that are specific to an application's needs.

#### How do you decide when to use .NET Standard Class Library as against .NET Core Library
- When you use the .NET Standard library type you will reduce the .NET surface area and at the same time increase the number of apps that are compatible with your library.
- You should use the .NET Core library type when the motive is to increase the .NET API surface area. But remember this also limits the compatibility of the library to only .NET Core applications.

#### What is the purpose of webHostBuilder()
- The webHostBuilder() as the name suggests is a factory used to create a web host for a web application. This function also configures the bits needed by the web host to run the application. It is a part of Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting namespace.

#### (IMPORTANT) Explain the difference between Task and Thread in .NET
- In simple terms, a task is something you want to get done, and a thread is a way to accomplish it. So in this sense, a thread is a part of the task.
- A thread represents the smallest unit of code processing at the OS level, with stacks and kernels. You can exercise a high degree of control over threads with Suspend() or Abort() or Resume() a thread. ThreadPool, as the name suggests is a wrapper comprising a pool of threads maintained in the runtime environment by CLR.
- A task in comparison is executed by a TaskScheduler and cannot create its own OS threads. A default scheduler runs on the ThreadPool and also lets you know when the task finishes and returns a result.














































Task VS Thread
Its a good practice to only Thread is modify its property no other thread modify the property that is declare by other thread
That is how you can understand what to choose over async await & Thread
Async Await is Simpler but Thread is difficult to implement
Async/await is a feature in C# that allows you to write asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way. It is built on top of the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) and allows you to perform asynchronous operations without blocking the calling thread.
When you use async/await, the compiler generates code to handle asynchronous operations, allowing you to write code that looks synchronous but operates asynchronously, making it easier to manage asynchronous workflows.




























Middleware
Middleware Calls the next Middleware in the PipeLine
The Terminating Middle does not call the next middle it just return
To Continue Execution of the Code we to call the next() function for continue process
Channing PipeLine (Middleware Process)
Middleware A B C (A wrap around B and B Wrap around C and C is the Terminating Middleware)
App.Use(), app.Map() app.Run(), app.MapWhen(), app.UseWhen()
Creating Custom Middleware by IMiddleware has InvokeAsync Method
Then Register in DI Container
Then Add app.UseMiddleware<MiddlewareNameHere>();

Singleton Design Pattern
The singleton design pattern ensures that only one object of its kind exists, and provides global access to it for any other code. This design pattern can be implemented in a number of ways, using:
Thread-safety singleton
Thread-safety singleton using double-check locking
No thread-safe singleton
Thread-safe without a lock
.NET 4’s Lazy<T> type

Configurations
Settings files, such as appsettings.json
Environment variables
Azure Key Vault
Azure App Configuration
Command-line arguments
Custom providers, installed or created
Directory files
In-memory .NET objects


Linq Operators
Apologies for the confusion. I understand now that you are asking about the different categories of LINQ extension methods based on their operations. LINQ extension methods can be categorized into the following groups based on the type of operation they perform:

**Filtering Operators**:
`Where`: Filters elements from a sequence based on a specified condition.
`OfType`: Filters elements of a sequence based on their type.

**Projection Operators**:
`Select`: Projects each element of a sequence into a new form.
`SelectMany`: Projects each element of a sequence to a collection and flattens the resulting sequences into one sequence.

**Sorting Operators**:
`OrderBy`: Sorts elements of a sequence in ascending order based on a key.
`OrderByDescending`: Sorts elements of a sequence in descending order based on a key.
`ThenBy`: Performs a secondary sort on the elements of a sequence in ascending order based on a key.
`ThenByDescending`: Performs a secondary sort on the elements of a sequence in descending order based on a key.
`Reverse`: Reverses the order of elements in a sequence.

**Set Operators**:
`Distinct`: Returns distinct elements from a sequence.
`Union`: Produces the union of two sequences, removing duplicate elements.
`Intersect`: Produces the intersection of two sequences, returning elements that exist in both sequences.
`Except`: Produces the set difference of two sequences, returning elements that exist in the first sequence but not in the second sequence.

**Partitioning Operators**:
`Take`: Returns a specified number of elements from the start of a sequence.
`Skip`: Bypasses a specified number of elements from the start of a sequence.
`TakeWhile`: Returns elements from a sequence as long as a specified condition is true.
`SkipWhile`: Bypasses elements from a sequence as long as a specified condition is true.

**Join Operators**:
`Join`: Joins two sequences based on a common key.
`GroupJoin`: Performs a group join on two sequences based on a common key.

 **Aggregation Operators**:
`Count`: Returns the number of elements in a sequence.
`Sum`: Computes the sum of a sequence of numeric values.
`Average`: Computes the average of a sequence of numeric values.
`Min`: Returns the minimum value in a sequence.
`Max`: Returns the maximum value in a sequence.
`Aggregate`: Performs a custom aggregation operation on a sequence.

These are some of the major categories of LINQ extension methods based on the types of operations they perform. Each category contains multiple LINQ methods that provide various functionalities for querying and manipulating data in .NET applications.



Entity Framework with Stored Procedure Example 
CREATE PROCEDURE InsertEmployee
    @FirstName NVARCHAR(100),
    @LastName NVARCHAR(100),
    @Age INT
    @TotalEmployees INT OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;

    INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Age)
    VALUES (@FirstName, @LastName, @Age);
    SELECT @TotalEmployees = COUNT(*) FROM Employees;

    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
END

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        using (var dbContext = new EmployeeDbContext())
        {
            int targetEmployeeId = 1;
            var employeeIdParameter = new SqlParameter("@EmployeeId", targetEmployeeId);
            var totalEmployeesParameter = new SqlParameter
            {
                ParameterName = "@TotalEmployees",
                SqlDbType = SqlDbType.Int,
                Direction = ParameterDirection.Output
            };
            var employees = dbContext.Employees
                .FromSqlRaw("EXEC GetEmployeeByIdWithOutput 
@EmployeeId, @TotalEmployees OUTPUT", employeeIdParameter, totalEmployeesParameter).ToList();
            int totalEmployees = (int)totalEmployeesParameter.Value;
            Console.WriteLine($"Employee ID: {targetEmployeeId}, Total Employees: {totalEmployees}");
            foreach (var employee in employees)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Employee ID: { employee.EmployeeId }, Name: { employee.FirstName } { employee.LastName }, Age: {employee.Age}");
            }
        }
    }
}


Design Patterns

Design patterns are categorized into three main types based on their purpose and scope: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns. Each type of design pattern serves a specific purpose in software design.

1. **Creational Patterns**:
Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility and control over object instantiation.

**Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. Examples include LoggerFactory in .NET Core and LoggerFactory in Java.
**Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Examples include System.Data.Common.DbProviderFactory in .NET and javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory in Java.
**Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Examples include Logger in many logging libraries and Runtime in Java.
**Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. Examples include StringBuilder in .NET and StringBuilder in Java.
**Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying existing objects and modifying them if necessary. Examples include ICloneable interface in .NET and java.lang.Cloneable interface in Java.

2. **Structural Patterns**:
Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures.

**Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect. Examples include System.Data.Common.DbDataAdapter in .NET and java.util.Arrays.asList() in Java.
**Decorator**: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Examples include Stream classes in .NET and IO classes in Java.
**Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system, acting as a unified interface to a set of interfaces. Examples include high-level APIs in many libraries and Java Servlet API.
**Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. Examples include ADO.NET in .NET and JDBC in Java.
**Composite**: Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Examples include System.Windows.Forms.Control in .NET and java.awt.Container in Java.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**:
Behavioral patterns focus on the interaction between objects and the delegation of responsibilities.

**Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, ensuring that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified. Examples include INotifyPropertyChanged in .NET and java.util.Observer in Java.
**Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms in separate classes and makes them interchangeable, allowing clients to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime. Examples include Collections.sort() in Java and System.Text.StringBuilder in .NET.
**Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with different requests and queuing of requests. Examples include ICommand interface in .NET and java.lang.Runnable interface in Java.
**Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Examples include System.Web.UI.Page in .NET and HttpServlet in Java.
**State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. Examples include System.Threading.Thread in .NET and javax.swing.ButtonModel in Java.

These are just a few examples of design patterns in each category. Design patterns help in solving common software design problems and promote flexibility, maintainability, and reusability in code. However, it's essential to choose the appropriate pattern based on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the characteristics of your software project.
