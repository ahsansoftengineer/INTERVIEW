## Layering

### What is Layering in ASP .NET CORE?
- Layering is a design pattern in which an application is divided into layers, each with a specific responsibility. In .NET Core, layering can be used to organize the code in a web application, making it easier to maintain and understand.
- There are several different ways to implement layering in a .NET Core application. Some common layers include:
- By separating the code into different layers, it is easier to change or maintain one layer without affecting the other layers. It also makes it easier to test the application, as each layer can be tested independently.

1. Presentation layer: This layer contains the user interface of the application, including views, controllers, and view models.

2. Business logic layer: This layer contains the business logic of the application, including any rules or calculations that need to be performed.

3. Data access layer: This layer is responsible for interacting with the database or other data stores, including querying and updating data.

4. Infrastructure layer: This layer contains any utility or infrastructure code that is required by the *other layers*, such as logging, caching, or messaging.

### More Layers
In .NET Core applications, the term "layer" typically refers to the architectural layers that are used to organize and structure the application. Common architectural layers in a typical .NET Core application include:

1. **Presentation Layer:** This layer is responsible for user interface and user interaction. It often includes components like controllers, views, and view models in web applications.

2. **Application Layer:** This layer contains the application's business logic and orchestrates the flow of data between the other layers. It includes services, application services, and other components that implement the business rules.

3. **Domain Layer:** The domain layer is where the core business logic and entities reside. It represents the concepts and rules of the problem domain.

4. **Infrastructure Layer:** This layer deals with external concerns such as data access, external services, and other infrastructure-related code. It includes components like repositories, data access logic, and external service integrations.

5. **Persistence Layer:** This layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data. It includes components like databases, data models, and data access logic.

6. **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Logging, Authentication, and Caching
7. **Contract Layer:**

These layers help in organizing and maintaining a clean architecture, but the exact number and composition of layers can vary based on the specific needs of the application. It's also worth noting that in modern software development, there's a trend towards simplifying architectures and avoiding unnecessary layers, especially in smaller applications.
