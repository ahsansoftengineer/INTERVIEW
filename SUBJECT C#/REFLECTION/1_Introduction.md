## Suite in Dotnet Core?
In .NET Core, a suite typically refers to a collection of related libraries, tools, and frameworks that are designed to work together. These suites are often referred to as software development kits (SDKs) or packages.

## Reflection and Attributes
- In C#, attributes provide a way to add metadata or declarative information to types and their members. They allow you to annotate and extend the behavior of classes, methods, properties, and other code elements. Attributes are defined using square brackets ([ ]) placed before the declaration of the target element.

1. Purpose: Attributes provide additional information about elements in your code, such as classes, methods, or properties. They can be used for various purposes, including documentation, serialization, validation, runtime behavior modification, and more.
2. Syntax: Attributes are declared using the [AttributeName] syntax.
3. Usage: Attributes can be applied at different levels, including assembly-level, type-level, method-level, parameter-level, and more. The availability and usage of attributes depend on the specific context and requirements.
4. Predefined Attributes: The .NET Framework provides several predefined attributes, such as [Obsolete] for marking elements as outdated, [Serializable] for indicating that a type can be serialized, [DllImport] for importing functions from native libraries, and many others.
5. Custom Attributes: You can define your own attributes by creating a class that inherits from the System.Attribute base class. By convention, custom attribute names often end with the "Attribute" suffix. Custom attributes can be used to add domain-specific metadata or control the behavior of your code.
6. Accessing Attributes: You can retrieve attribute information at runtime using reflection. This allows you to inspect and analyze the attributes applied to types and their members, enabling dynamic behavior based on the attribute values.
7. Multiple Attributes: You can apply multiple attributes to the same target element by separating them with commas. This allows you to combine multiple metadata or behaviors on a single code element.
8. Overall, attributes in C# provide a flexible mechanism to extend and enhance your code by adding metadata and declarative information. They enable a wide range of scenarios, from documentation and code analysis to runtime behavior modification and customization.
