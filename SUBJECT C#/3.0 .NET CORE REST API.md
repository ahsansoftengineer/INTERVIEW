### BUILDING BLOCKS OF .NET CORE API

ASP.NET Core is a versatile framework for building web applications, including APIs. When building a .NET Core API, you'll work with various building blocks and components to create a functional and scalable API. Here are the key building blocks of a .NET Core API:

1. **Controllers**:
   - Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and define the API's endpoints. They contain action methods that process the requests and return responses.

2. **Routing**:
   - Routing is responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific controllers and action methods. You can configure routes in the `Startup.cs` file using the routing middleware.

3. **Models**:
   - Models represent the data structures used by your API. These can be classes or objects that define the shape of the data exchanged between clients and the API.

4. **Middleware**:
   - Middleware components can be added to the HTTP request processing pipeline to perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, and error handling.

5. **Services**:
   - Services encapsulate the business logic and data access for your API. They can be registered as singletons, scoped, or transient services in the application's dependency injection container.

6. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
   - ASP.NET Core supports a built-in DI container. You can use dependency injection to manage and provide access to services and components throughout your application.

7. **Action Results**:
   - Action methods in controllers return action results, which encapsulate the data to be returned as an HTTP response. Common action results include `Ok`, `BadRequest`, `NotFound`, and custom results like `CreatedAtRoute`.

8. **Middleware for Authentication and Authorization**:
   - ASP.NET Core provides middleware for handling authentication and authorization, such as JWT Bearer authentication and role-based authorization.

9. **Filters**:
   - Filters can be used to add cross-cutting concerns to the request/response pipeline. Common filters include authorization filters, exception filters, and action filters.

10. **Validation**:
    - ASP.NET Core supports data validation through attributes and the `ModelState` object. You can validate incoming data to ensure it meets specific criteria before processing.

11. **Configuration**:
    - Configuration settings, such as database connection strings or API keys, can be stored in configuration files or environment variables and accessed in the application.

12. **Logging**:
    - ASP.NET Core has built-in support for logging. You can configure and use various logging providers to monitor and troubleshoot your API.

13. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**:
    - If your API requires data storage, you can use EF Core to interact with databases. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for data access.

14. **Swagger and API Documentation**:
    - You can use libraries like Swashbuckle to generate interactive API documentation, making it easy to document and test your API.

15. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:
    - CORS middleware can be configured to control which domains are allowed to access your API. This is essential for handling cross-origin requests from web clients.

16. **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**:
    - ASP.NET Core supports unit testing and integration testing to ensure that your API functions correctly and reliably.

17. **WebSockets**:
    - WebSockets can be used for real-time communication and building features like chat applications. ASP.NET Core has support for WebSockets.

18. **Health Checks**:
    - You can add health checks to monitor the status of your API and its dependencies, providing insights into its overall health.

19. **Hosting**:
    - ASP.NET Core applications can be hosted on various platforms, such as IIS, Azure, AWS, and Docker containers.

These building blocks and components make ASP.NET Core a powerful framework for building robust and scalable APIs. You can choose and configure the components based on your specific requirements and application architecture.

### LIFE TIME OF DEPENDENCY INJECTION 
- In .NET Core (now known as .NET 5 and later), dependency injection (DI) plays a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of objects and their dependencies in applications, including ASP.NET Core APIs. The lifetime of a dependency determines how long an instance of that dependency is kept in memory. .NET Core offers three main built-in dependency injection lifetimes:

1. **Transient:** Transient dependencies are created each time they are requested from the service container. These instances are not reused, which means a new instance is created for every request. Transient lifetime is suitable for lightweight and stateless services.

   ```csharp
   services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
   ```

2. **Scoped:** Scoped dependencies are created once per HTTP request (in the case of ASP.NET Core APIs). This means that a new instance of the service is created for each incoming HTTP request, and the same instance is used for the entire duration of that request. Scoped lifetime is ideal for services that should maintain state within a single request.

   ```csharp
   services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
   ```

3. **Singleton:** Singleton dependencies are created once and then shared across all requests. A single instance of the service is created for the entire lifetime of the application. Singleton lifetime is suitable for services that should be shared globally and have a long lifespan.

   ```csharp
   services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
   ```

Here's how you typically configure dependency injection in an ASP.NET Core API:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Transient lifetime
    services.AddTransient<IMyTransientService, MyTransientService>();

    // Scoped lifetime
    services.AddScoped<IMyScopedService, MyScopedService>();

    // Singleton lifetime
    services.AddSingleton<IMySingletonService, MySingletonService>();

    // Register other services and configurations
}
```

When choosing the appropriate lifetime for your services, consider factors like the statefulness of the service, memory usage, and performance requirements. Transient services are lightweight but not suitable for maintaining state. Scoped services are often used for maintaining per-request state, and Singleton services are used for globally shared state or resources.

The choice of dependency injection lifetime is essential to ensure that your application behaves as expected and efficiently manages resources and dependencies.


### .NET CORE IDENTITY
ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system that provides built-in user management features for ASP.NET Core applications. It simplifies the process of managing user accounts, authentication, and authorization in web applications. Here are some key aspects of .NET Core Identity:

1. **User Authentication:** .NET Core Identity provides mechanisms for user authentication, including username/password-based login, external login providers (e.g., Google, Facebook), and multi-factor authentication.

2. **User Management:** It offers a straightforward way to manage user accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting users. You can also customize user profiles by extending the built-in user entity with additional properties.

3. **Role-Based Authorization:** Identity allows you to define roles and associate users with roles, enabling role-based authorization for controlling access to different parts of your application.

4. **Claims-Based Identity:** Identity is claims-based, meaning that user information is represented as claims, which can be used to grant or deny access to specific resources.

5. **Password Hashing:** It securely hashes and stores user passwords, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.

6. **Token Management:** Identity supports token-based authentication, which is essential for building web APIs and providing authentication tokens to clients.

7. **Integration with ASP.NET Core:** Identity is tightly integrated with ASP.NET Core, making it easy to incorporate authentication and authorization into your web applications. It uses ASP.NET Core's middleware and services.

8. **Customization:** You can customize Identity to meet the specific requirements of your application, including changing the UI, modifying the data storage, or extending user profiles.

9. **Entity Framework Integration:** Identity can be used with Entity Framework Core for data storage and management, which simplifies database-related tasks.

10. **Password Policies:** It allows you to configure password policies, including requirements for password strength and expiration.

11. **Security Features:** Identity includes protection against common security threats, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

12. **Logging and Events:** Identity generates various events that you can subscribe to for logging, auditing, or custom actions, such as sending email notifications when users are created or change their passwords.

To use .NET Core Identity in your application, you typically start by adding Identity services to your project and configuring options like user authentication and authorization settings. You can then scaffold Identity pages and views for user registration, login, and profile management, or customize them to match your application's UI.

.NET Core Identity simplifies the process of adding user management and authentication features to ASP.NET Core applications, saving developers time and effort when building secure and user-friendly web applications.

### EXAMPLE OF .NET CORE IDENTITY
Sure, here's a simple example of using .NET Core Identity in an ASP.NET Core application to demonstrate user registration and authentication. Keep in mind that in a real-world application, you would typically customize the user interface and integrate more complex features.

1. Create a new ASP.NET Core project:

   You can create a new project using the `dotnet` command-line tool or your favorite development environment. For simplicity, let's assume you have a new ASP.NET Core project.

2. Install the required NuGet packages:

   In the project's `.csproj` file, make sure you have references to the following Identity-related packages:

   ```xml
   <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="6.0.0" />
   <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" Version="6.0.0" />
   ```

3. Configure Identity in `Startup.cs`:

   In the `Startup.cs` file, configure Identity services and define your database connection string. Here's a simplified configuration:

   ```csharp
   services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
       options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

   services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>(options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
       .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
   ```

4. Create a registration page:

   Create a registration page in your application's views (e.g., `Register.cshtml`). Use the Identity scaffolding to generate the registration view or create a custom one.

5. Create a controller for user registration:

   Create a controller that handles user registration. Here's a simple example:

   ```csharp
   public class AccountController : Controller
   {
       private readonly SignInManager<IdentityUser> _signInManager;
       private readonly UserManager<IdentityUser> _userManager;

       public AccountController(UserManager<IdentityUser> userManager, SignInManager<IdentityUser> signInManager)
       {
           _userManager = userManager;
           _signInManager = signInManager;
       }

       [HttpGet]
       public IActionResult Register()
       {
           return View();
       }

       [HttpPost]
       public async Task<IActionResult> Register(RegisterViewModel model)
       {
           if (ModelState.IsValid)
           {
               var user = new IdentityUser { UserName = model.Email, Email = model.Email };
               var result = await _userManager.CreateAsync(user, model.Password);
               if (result.Succeeded)
               {
                   await _signInManager.SignInAsync(user, isPersistent: false);
                   return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
               }
               foreach (var error in result.Errors)
               {
                   ModelState.AddModelError(string.Empty, error.Description);
               }
           }
           return View(model);
       }
   }
   ```

6. Customize and secure your application:

   You can further customize your application by adding features like email confirmation, password reset, role-based authorization, and more.

This example demonstrates a basic registration process using .NET Core Identity. In a real-world application, you'd expand on this foundation to create a fully featured and secure user management system.
