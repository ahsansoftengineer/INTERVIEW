### KESTRAL VS IIS
It seems like you're comparing two different things: "kestrel" and "IIS." Kestrel and IIS are components used in web application hosting, and they serve different purposes in the context of web development. Let me explain each one:

1. Kestrel:
   - Kestrel is a lightweight, cross-platform web server that is often used as the default web server for ASP.NET Core applications.
   - It is written in C# and designed to be fast and efficient. Kestrel is a part of the ASP.NET Core stack.
   - Kestrel is typically used to serve ASP.NET Core applications and can be used in combination with a reverse proxy server, such as Nginx or IIS, for load balancing, SSL termination, and other advanced features.
   - Kestrel is commonly used for hosting ASP.NET Core applications on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

2. IIS (Internet Information Services):
   - IIS is a web server and application server created by Microsoft and primarily used on Windows-based servers.
   - It provides a wide range of features for hosting websites, web applications, and services on Windows Server operating systems.
   - IIS supports various web technologies, including ASP.NET, Classic ASP, PHP, and more.
   - IIS can be used to host a variety of web applications, not limited to ASP.NET. It is often used in conjunction with Windows Server and can offer a comprehensive set of web hosting and management features.

In summary, Kestrel is a web server that is commonly used for hosting ASP.NET Core applications, while IIS is a full-featured web server and application server primarily used on Windows-based servers. Depending on your specific needs and platform, you may choose to use one or both of these components in your web application infrastructure.
