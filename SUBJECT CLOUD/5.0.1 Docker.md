### DOCKER DEFINATION
- Docker is a platform and ecosystem for developing, shipping, and running applications within lightweight, portable containers. Containers are isolated, standardized units that package an application and its dependencies, making it easier to build, deploy, and manage software across different environments. Docker provides tools and components for container creation, distribution, orchestration, and management, simplifying the development and deployment of applications.
### DOCKER COMPONENTS
Docker is composed of several key components that work together to enable containerization and container management. Here are the most common Docker components:

1. **Docker Engine**: Docker Engine is the core component responsible for creating and running containers. It consists of:
   - Docker Daemon: A background service that manages container execution, image management, and network and storage resources.
   - Docker Client: A command-line tool (e.g., `docker` command) used to interact with the Docker Daemon to build, run, and manage containers.

2. **Docker Image**: A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Images are used as the basis for creating containers.

3. **Docker Container**: A container is an instance of a Docker image that runs as a separate and isolated process. Containers are lightweight and share the host OS kernel while having their own user space, file system, and runtime environment.

4. **Docker Registry**: A Docker registry is a repository for storing and distributing Docker images. Docker Hub is a popular public registry, but you can also run your private registries using Docker Registry or other solutions like Amazon ECR or Google Container Registry.

5. **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to specify services, networks, and volumes, making it easier to manage complex applications with multiple containers.

6. **Dockerfile**: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, dependencies, environment variables, and runtime configuration for a containerized application.

7. **Docker Network**: Docker provides various network modes to enable communication between containers. Docker networks allow containers to connect to each other or to external networks and services.

8. **Docker Volume**: Docker volumes are used to persist and manage data outside of a container's file system. Volumes are typically used for data that needs to survive container restarts or be shared among multiple containers.

9. **Docker Hub**: Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository for sharing and distributing Docker images. It hosts a wide variety of official and community-contributed images that can be pulled and used in your Docker environment.

10. **Docker Swarm**: Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker. It allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes to deploy and scale services across a swarm of machines.

11. **Docker CLI**: The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that allows users to interact with Docker and perform various operations related to container management, such as creating, running, and managing containers.

These components are the building blocks of Docker and are used in various combinations to package, deploy, and manage containerized applications. Understanding how these components work together is essential for effectively using Docker for containerization and container management.

### Docker Commands
Docker CLI Commands:
1. `docker --version`: Check the Docker version.
2. `docker info`: Get detailed information about your Docker installation.
3. `docker images`: List all locally available Docker images.
4. `docker pull image_name:tag`: Download a Docker image from a registry.
5. `docker build -t image_name:tag .`: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
6. `docker run -it --name container_name image_name:tag`: Create and start a container from an image.
7. `docker ps`: List running containers.
8. `docker ps -a`: List all containers, including stopped ones.
9. `docker stop container_id`: Stop a running container.
10. `docker start container_id`: Start a stopped container.
11. `docker restart container_id`: Restart a container.
12. `docker exec -it container_id command`: Run a command inside a running container.
13. `docker logs container_id`: View the logs of a container.
14. `docker rm container_id`: Remove a container (use `-f` to force removal).
15. `docker rmi image_id`: Remove an image (use `-f` to force removal).
16. `docker network ls`: Manage Docker networks.
17. `docker volume ls`: Manage Docker volumes.
18. `docker-compose up`: Start your application defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
19. `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
20. `docker-compose build`: Build or rebuild services (images) defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
