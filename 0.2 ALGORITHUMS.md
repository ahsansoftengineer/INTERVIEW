**Common Algorithms:**

1. **Sorting Algorithms:** Sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort are used to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending.

2. **Searching Algorithms:** Searching algorithms like Binary Search and Linear Search are used to find elements within a data structure.

3. **Recursion:** Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's often used in algorithms for tasks like tree traversal.

4. **Dynamic Programming:** Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and caching the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

5. **Greedy Algorithms:** Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a globally optimal solution. They are used in various optimization problems.

6. **Graph Algorithms:** Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) are used for solving problems related to graphs.

7. **Divide and Conquer:** Divide and conquer is a problem-solving approach that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves the subproblems, and combines their solutions to solve the original problem.

8. **Backtracking:** Backtracking is a technique used to solve problems by trying out different possibilities and undoing choices that lead to dead ends.

9. **String Algorithms:** Algorithms like string matching (e.g., Knuth-Morris-Pratt), string editing (e.g., Levenshtein distance), and regular expression matching are used for string manipulation.

- These are just a few examples of common data structures and algorithms used in programming. 
- The choice of data structure and algorithm depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the trade-offs between time and space complexity.
