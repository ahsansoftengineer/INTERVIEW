### KUBERNETES
- Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, management, and operation of containerized applications. It provides a unified and highly flexible framework for container orchestration, allowing you to efficiently manage and coordinate the deployment and scaling of containers across clusters of machines, simplifying the management of complex, microservices-based applications.

### KUBERNETES VS DOCKER-COMPOSE

Docker Compose and Kubernetes are both container orchestration tools, but they serve different purposes and are suitable for different scenarios. Here's a comparison of Docker Compose and Kubernetes:

#### Scope:
- Docker Compose: Designed for defining and running multi-container applications on a single host or for local development and testing.
- Kubernetes: Designed for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts or clusters in a production environment.

#### Orchestration:
- Docker Compose: Provides basic orchestration capabilities, but it primarily focuses on defining services, networks, and volumes for containers running on a single host.
- Kubernetes: Offers robust container orchestration features, including scaling, rolling updates, load balancing, and self-healing for containers distributed across multiple nodes.


### Commands
Here are some of the most commonly used Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) commands and their descriptions, arranged in a single list:

1. `kubectl version`: Check the client and server version of kubectl and the Kubernetes cluster.

2. `kubectl cluster-info`: Display information about the Kubernetes cluster, including the master's URL.

3. `kubectl get pods`: List all pods in the current namespace.

4. `kubectl get nodes`: List all worker nodes in the cluster.

5. `kubectl get services`: List all services in the current namespace.

6. `kubectl get deployments`: List all deployments in the current namespace.

7. `kubectl create -f file.yaml`: Create a resource from a YAML file.

8. `kubectl apply -f file.yaml`: Apply or update a resource using a YAML file.

9. `kubectl describe pod pod_name`: Display detailed information about a specific pod.

10. `kubectl logs pod_name`: View the logs of a specific pod.

11. `kubectl exec -it pod_name -- /bin/sh`: Run an interactive shell in a specific pod.

12. `kubectl delete pod pod_name`: Delete a specific pod.

13. `kubectl delete deployment deployment_name`: Delete a specific deployment.

14. `kubectl expose deployment deployment_name --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer`: Expose a deployment as a service with a load balancer.

15. `kubectl scale deployment deployment_name --replicas=3`: Scale the number of replicas for a deployment.

16. `kubectl get namespaces`: List all namespaces in the cluster.

17. `kubectl create namespace namespace_name`: Create a new namespace.

18. `kubectl config get-contexts`: List all available contexts for kubectl.

19. `kubectl config use-context context_name`: Set the current context for kubectl.

20. `kubectl get configmap configmap_name -o json`: Display the contents of a ConfigMap in JSON format.

21. `kubectl apply -f secret.yaml`: Apply a secret from a YAML file.

22. `kubectl edit deployment deployment_name`: Open the deployment in a text editor for editing.

23. `kubectl get events`: List cluster events, including pod scheduling and service changes.

24. `kubectl rollout status deployment/deployment_name`: Check the status of a deployment rollout.

25. `kubectl scale deployment deployment_name --replicas=3`: Scale the number of replicas for a deployment.

These commands cover a wide range of tasks for managing Kubernetes clusters, including deploying applications, inspecting resources, and troubleshooting issues.
