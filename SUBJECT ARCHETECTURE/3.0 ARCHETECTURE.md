## ARCHETECTURE
In the context of programming, the term "architecture" can refer to the high-level design or structure of a software system, which includes the organization of components, modules, and how they interact with each other. Different architectural patterns and styles are used in software development to address various design and structural concerns. Here are some common software architecture patterns:

### Architecture VS Design Patterns
- Architecture defines the big picture of a system, while design patterns provide specific solutions to individual design problems that arise within that system. Both are important aspects of software development, and using them together can help create software systems that are scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements over time.

1. **Layered Architecture:** In a layered architecture, a software system is divided into logical layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality. Common layers include the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. This separation helps with modularity and maintainability.

2. **Client-Server Architecture:** This architecture involves dividing the system into client and server components. Clients request services or resources from servers, and servers provide those services. It's commonly used in web applications where the client is a web browser, and the server handles requests and serves web pages.

3. **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** MVC is an architectural pattern commonly used in web and desktop applications. It separates the application into three interconnected components: the model (data and business logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (handles user input and updates the model and view).

4. **Microservices Architecture:** Microservices involve breaking down a software system into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each service focuses on a specific piece of functionality and communicates with others via APIs.

5. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** SOA is an architectural style that focuses on designing software components as services that are loosely coupled and can be reused across different applications. Services communicate with each other through defined interfaces.

6. **Event-Driven Architecture:** In an event-driven architecture, components communicate by generating and handling events. It's often used in systems that need to respond to asynchronous events or messages.

7. **Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Architecture:** This architecture emphasizes a clear separation between the core application logic (hexagon) and external dependencies (ports and adapters). It allows for the easy replacement of external components.

8. **Component-Based Architecture:** In component-based architecture, a software system is built as a collection of reusable, self-contained components. Each component encapsulates a specific set of functionalities and can be easily integrated into the system.

9. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture:** In P2P systems, nodes in a network communicate and collaborate with each other without a central server. It's commonly used in distributed systems, file sharing, and communication applications.

10. **Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** These architectural patterns are often used in systems where auditing, tracking, and replaying of events are crucial. Event sourcing captures all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events, and CQRS separates the command (write) and query (read) operations.

The choice of software architecture depends on the requirements of the application, including scalability, maintainability, performance, and the problem domain. Architects and developers select the architecture that best aligns with the specific needs and goals of the project.

### WHAT TYPE IS IT
1. SLA (Service Layer Agreement)
2. Clean Architecture (TDD, BDD, DDD)
3. TDD (Test Driven Dev) uses code-based tests
4. BDD (Behavior Driven Dev)  uses natural language tests
5. DDD (Domain Driven Dev)  uses a domain specific language
6. Event Driven Architecture 
Clean Architecture also known as, Hexagonal Arch, Onion Arch, Ports and Adapters
