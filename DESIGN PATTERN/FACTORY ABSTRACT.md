The Abstract Factory Pattern is another creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's an extension of the Factory Pattern, where a family of related or dependent products is created together, ensuring compatibility among the created objects. Here are some key points about the Abstract Factory Pattern:

1. **Intent:**
- The main intent is to provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

2. **Structure:**
   - Involves multiple interfaces and classes:
- **AbstractFactory:** Declares the interface for creating a family of products.
- **ConcreteFactory:** Implements the AbstractFactory interface, creating a family of related products.
- **AbstractProduct:** Declares the interface for a type of product.
- **ConcreteProduct:** Implements the AbstractProduct interface, defining a specific product type.
- **Client:** Uses interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct to work with the family of products.

3. **Key Components:**
- **AbstractFactory:** Declares the creation methods for a family of products.
- **ConcreteFactory:** Implements the creation methods, creating specific products.
- **AbstractProduct:** Declares the interface for a type of product.
- **ConcreteProduct:** Implements the AbstractProduct interface, defining the actual product.
- **Client:** Uses the AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct interfaces to create and work with product families.

4. **Benefits:**
- **Ensures Compatibility:** It ensures that the created objects are compatible and can work together.
- **Promotes Consistency:** It promotes consistency among the created objects, as they belong to the same family.
- **Easy Extension:** Adding new product families is easier than modifying existing code.

5. **Example in C#:**
   ```csharp
   using System;

   // AbstractProduct interface
   interface IChair
   {
       void Create();
   }

   // ConcreteProduct classes
   class ModernChair : IChair
   {
       public void Create()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Modern Chair created");
       }
   }

   class VictorianChair : IChair
   {
       public void Create()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Victorian Chair created");
       }
   }

   // AbstractFactory interface
   interface IFurnitureFactory
   {
       IChair CreateChair();
   }

   // ConcreteFactory classes
   class ModernFurnitureFactory : IFurnitureFactory
   {
       public IChair CreateChair()
       {
           return new ModernChair();
       }
   }

   class VictorianFurnitureFactory : IFurnitureFactory
   {
       public IChair CreateChair()
       {
           return new VictorianChair();
       }
   }

   // Client code
   class Program
   {
       static void Main()
       {
           // Using ModernFurnitureFactory
           IFurnitureFactory modernFactory = new ModernFurnitureFactory();
           IChair modernChair = modernFactory.CreateChair();
           modernChair.Create();

           // Using VictorianFurnitureFactory
           IFurnitureFactory victorianFactory = new VictorianFurnitureFactory();
           IChair victorianChair = victorianFactory.CreateChair();
           victorianChair.Create();
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `IFurnitureFactory` interface declares the method `CreateChair()`, and the concrete factories (`ModernFurnitureFactory` and `VictorianFurnitureFactory`) implement this interface to create a family of related products (chairs). The client code uses these factories to create chairs without specifying their concrete classes, ensuring that the created chairs are compatible within the same style or family.
