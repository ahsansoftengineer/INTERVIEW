### **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
- **Definition:** Test-Driven Development is a software development process in which tests are written before the code they are intended to validate. The cycle typically involves writing a test, writing the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and then refactoring the code.
- **Key Steps in TDD:**
  - **Red:** Write a failing test that defines a piece of functionality.
  - **Green:** Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass.
  - **Refactor:** Refactor the code while keeping it functional.

Certainly! Let's go through a simple example of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in a .NET Core application. In TDD, you write tests before you write the actual code. We'll use xUnit as the testing framework.

### Step 1: Create a .NET Core Project

Create a new .NET Core project using your preferred method (e.g., `dotnet new console -n TDDExample`). Move to the project directory.

### Step 2: Install xUnit NuGet Packages

Install the xUnit NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package xunit
dotnet add package xunit.runner.visualstudio
```

### Step 3: Write a Test

Create a test file (e.g., `CalculatorTests.cs`) in the `Tests` folder of your project:

```csharp
using Xunit;

namespace TDDExample.Tests
{
    public class CalculatorTests
    {
        [Fact]
        public void Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsSum()
        {
            // Arrange
            var calculator = new Calculator();

            // Act
            var result = calculator.Add(3, 4);

            // Assert
            Assert.Equal(7, result);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Run Tests

Run the tests using:

```bash
dotnet test
```

### Step 5: Write Code to Make the Test Pass

Now, create a class `Calculator.cs` in your main project:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Run Tests Again

Run the tests again using:

```bash
dotnet test
```

The test should pass this time, indicating that your code meets the requirements defined in the test.

### Step 7: Add More Tests and Iterate

You can continue this cycle by adding more tests, enhancing the code to make the tests pass, and refactoring the code as needed.

This is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would likely have more complex logic and a more extensive suite of tests. The key principle is to write tests that define the expected behavior of your code and use those tests to drive the development process.
