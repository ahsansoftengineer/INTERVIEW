### Mediator in Short
- In a .NET Core application, the Mediator pattern, often implemented using libraries like MediatR, provides a centralized way to handle requests and commands. It allows you to separate your application's components, such as controllers and application services, from the specific logic of those requests. Here's a concise explanation:

- .NET Core Mediator: It's a pattern and library that facilitates communication and request handling by decoupling components in your application. It involves defining requests, request handlers, and using a central mediator to manage request processing. This helps maintain clean and testable code, simplifying the organization of your application's logic.

### What is Mediator Pattern?
1. The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to communicate with each other without the need for them to know about each other's identities. It promotes loose coupling between objects by providing a mediator object that handles all communication between them. This allows for a more flexible and maintainable system, as changes to the communication between objects can be made by modifying the mediator rather than the objects themselves. Examples of where the Mediator pattern might be useful include GUI frameworks, event systems, and multi-agent systems.

### Where does Mediator Pattern Used in Industry?
1. The Mediator pattern is used in a variety of industries, including software development, system design, and game development.
2. In software development, the Mediator pattern is often used in GUI frameworks to handle communication between different GUI components, such as buttons, text fields, and dialog boxes. By using a mediator to handle communication between these components, the components themselves can be made more reusable and easier to maintain.
3. In system design, the Mediator pattern can be used to design multi-agent systems, such as those used in transportation and logistics, where many agents (e.g. vehicles, warehouses) need to communicate with each other to coordinate their actions. By using a mediator to handle communication between the agents, the system can be made more robust and adaptable to changes.

### How does I Use Mediator Pattern Web Development?
1. In web development, there are some libraries and frameworks that already implement mediator pattern, such as Redux, Vuex, and MobX, which allow to manage state and communication between different parts of the application.

2. Overall, the Mediator pattern can be used in web development to handle communication between different parts of a web application in a decoupled way, making the system more modular and maintainable.

3. Overall, RxJS can be used as an example of the Mediator pattern in web development, as it allows for the creation of reactive and event-based systems where the library itself acts as the mediator, handling communication between different objects, promoting decoupling and maintainability.

### Mediator
- It separate Command Handler Code from, controllers and application services.
- It involves defining requests, request handlers, and using a central mediator to manage request processing. This helps maintain clean and testable code, simplifying the organization of your application's logic.

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the mediator, centralizes communication between multiple objects, allowing them to interact without being directly coupled. This pattern promotes a more decoupled and modular design.

Here's a simple example of the Mediator Pattern in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Mediator interface
public interface IMediator
{
    void SendMessage(string message, Colleague colleague);
}

// Colleague interface
public abstract class Colleague
{
    protected IMediator mediator;

    public Colleague(IMediator mediator)
    {
        this.mediator = mediator;
    }

    public abstract void ReceiveMessage(string message);
    public abstract void SendMessage(string message);
}

// Concrete Mediator
public class ConcreteMediator : IMediator
{
    private List<Colleague> colleagues = new List<Colleague>();

    public void RegisterColleague(Colleague colleague)
    {
        colleagues.Add(colleague);
    }

    public void SendMessage(string message, Colleague sendingColleague)
    {
        foreach (var colleague in colleagues)
        {
            if (colleague != sendingColleague)
            {
                colleague.ReceiveMessage(message);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Concrete Colleague
public class ConcreteColleague : Colleague
{
    public ConcreteColleague(IMediator mediator) : base(mediator) { }

    public override void ReceiveMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Colleague received message: {message}");
    }

    public override void SendMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Colleague sending message: {message}");
        mediator.SendMessage(message, this);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create mediator
        var mediator = new ConcreteMediator();

        // Create colleagues and register them with the mediator
        var colleague1 = new ConcreteColleague(mediator);
        var colleague2 = new ConcreteColleague(mediator);
        var colleague3 = new ConcreteColleague(mediator);

        mediator.RegisterColleague(colleague1);
        mediator.RegisterColleague(colleague2);
        mediator.RegisterColleague(colleague3);

        // Colleagues communicate through the mediator
        colleague1.SendMessage("Hello, colleagues!");

        /*
        Output:
        Colleague sending message: Hello, colleagues!
        Colleague received message: Hello, colleagues!
        Colleague received message: Hello, colleagues!
        Colleague received message: Hello, colleagues!
        */
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `IMediator` interface defines the communication contract between colleagues.
- The `ConcreteMediator` implements the mediator interface and keeps track of registered colleagues.
- The `Colleague` abstract class provides a base for concrete colleagues and holds a reference to the mediator.
- The `ConcreteColleague` class implements the concrete colleague and communicates with other colleagues through the mediator.

This simple example demonstrates how the Mediator Pattern helps to decouple the objects involved in communication, allowing them to interact without having direct dependencies on each other.
