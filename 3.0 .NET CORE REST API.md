### BUILDING BLOCKS OF .NET CORE API

ASP.NET Core is a versatile framework for building web applications, including APIs. When building a .NET Core API, you'll work with various building blocks and components to create a functional and scalable API. Here are the key building blocks of a .NET Core API:

1. **Controllers**:
   - Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and define the API's endpoints. They contain action methods that process the requests and return responses.

2. **Routing**:
   - Routing is responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific controllers and action methods. You can configure routes in the `Startup.cs` file using the routing middleware.

3. **Models**:
   - Models represent the data structures used by your API. These can be classes or objects that define the shape of the data exchanged between clients and the API.

4. **Middleware**:
   - Middleware components can be added to the HTTP request processing pipeline to perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, and error handling.

5. **Services**:
   - Services encapsulate the business logic and data access for your API. They can be registered as singletons, scoped, or transient services in the application's dependency injection container.

6. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
   - ASP.NET Core supports a built-in DI container. You can use dependency injection to manage and provide access to services and components throughout your application.

7. **Action Results**:
   - Action methods in controllers return action results, which encapsulate the data to be returned as an HTTP response. Common action results include `Ok`, `BadRequest`, `NotFound`, and custom results like `CreatedAtRoute`.

8. **Middleware for Authentication and Authorization**:
   - ASP.NET Core provides middleware for handling authentication and authorization, such as JWT Bearer authentication and role-based authorization.

9. **Filters**:
   - Filters can be used to add cross-cutting concerns to the request/response pipeline. Common filters include authorization filters, exception filters, and action filters.

10. **Validation**:
    - ASP.NET Core supports data validation through attributes and the `ModelState` object. You can validate incoming data to ensure it meets specific criteria before processing.

11. **Configuration**:
    - Configuration settings, such as database connection strings or API keys, can be stored in configuration files or environment variables and accessed in the application.

12. **Logging**:
    - ASP.NET Core has built-in support for logging. You can configure and use various logging providers to monitor and troubleshoot your API.

13. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**:
    - If your API requires data storage, you can use EF Core to interact with databases. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for data access.

14. **Swagger and API Documentation**:
    - You can use libraries like Swashbuckle to generate interactive API documentation, making it easy to document and test your API.

15. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:
    - CORS middleware can be configured to control which domains are allowed to access your API. This is essential for handling cross-origin requests from web clients.

16. **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**:
    - ASP.NET Core supports unit testing and integration testing to ensure that your API functions correctly and reliably.

17. **WebSockets**:
    - WebSockets can be used for real-time communication and building features like chat applications. ASP.NET Core has support for WebSockets.

18. **Health Checks**:
    - You can add health checks to monitor the status of your API and its dependencies, providing insights into its overall health.

19. **Hosting**:
    - ASP.NET Core applications can be hosted on various platforms, such as IIS, Azure, AWS, and Docker containers.

These building blocks and components make ASP.NET Core a powerful framework for building robust and scalable APIs. You can choose and configure the components based on your specific requirements and application architecture.
