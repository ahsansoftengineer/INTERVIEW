#### SIGNALR
- SignalR is an open-source library and framework developed by Microsoft for building real-time web applications. It enables bi-directional communication between clients (such as web browsers) and a server over a single, persistent WebSocket connection or other transport mechanisms. SignalR simplifies the implementation of real-time features like live chat, notifications, online gaming, and collaborative applications by allowing the server to push updates to connected clients instantly. It's commonly used in web development to create interactive and live-updating web applications.
