### DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHUMS
It seems like you're asking about common data structures and algorithms (DSA). Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and are used in a wide range of programming tasks. Here are some common data structures and algorithms used in programming:

**Common Data Structures:**
1. **Arrays:** Arrays are a collection of elements, usually of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
2. **Linked Lists:** Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. There are various types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
3. **Stacks:** Stacks are a data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are pushed onto the top of the stack and popped from the top.
4. **Queues:** Queues are a data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are enqueued at the rear and dequeued from the front.
5. **Trees:** Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. Common types include binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees like AVL and Red-Black trees.
6. **Hash Tables:** Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to values. They provide fast access to data with average-case constant-time complexity.
7. **Graphs:** Graphs are a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected and can have various properties.
